Part Three:  Enhancements
-------------------------

Add the following features to the program:

1) Alter the program such that only the correct output is sent to the standard
output stream (stdout), while error and help messages are sent to the standard
error stream (stderr).  (Hint: use fprintf.)

See the expected output listed in the comment at the top of main.c for an
example of what should go to stdout.

2) Implement an optional command-line switch '-fFILENAME' that sends program
output to a file named FILENAME (i.e., filename specified as a command line
argument).

3) Add support for matching arbitrary numbers of words, not just 5.
(Hint: use malloc, and don't worry too much about memory efficiency).

4) Safeguard the program from buffer overflow attacks. (Hint: 'gets'
is BAD.  Use fgets instead, which specifies the maximum number of
characters to be read in.)

5) Allow multiple words to be specified per line.
(Hint 1: Understand 'strtok'.
Hint 2: Be careful about the newline character '\n' at the end of the line.)
