Part1:

Pointers:
1)
The variable temp is simply a character pointer. It does not point to any assigned memory space to hold a string of characters so strcpy fails.

2)
The "./" in the command call are included in arg[0] hence its string length is 11 and not 9. temp can only hold a character string of 9 or less.

3)
buffer is pointing at a string constant. The value of a constant cannot be changed hence strcpy does not work. buffer needs to be a modifiable space like a character array or string type.

4)
This is correct as buffer points to a character array and thus can store the value word that strcpy copies into it. A simpler expression is " char *buffer = &b" as an array name acts as a pointer to the 1st element.

5)*
output: program1 5 abc

6)
buffer is a local variable to myfunc. Once this function ends the variable goes out of scope and the pointer to it is lost causing a segmentation fault.
PS: The parameter argv in myfunc() is never actually used inside the function.


Debugging:
1)
strcmp() returns a value of zero if two words are identical (which is what we want). Inside the if statement, zero(8 0-bits) is interpreted as false, hence we not with "!" to make it true (8 1-bits).

2)
The sizeof() operator used in lngth returns the size in bytes of the memory pointed to by s. So sizeof(s) returns the size the array in bytes. sizeof(*s) returns the size allocated to a single data entry (in this case the 1st entry) of s. Hence [total bytes in s]/[bytes per entry] gives array length.

3)
There should be a break or exit from the function or else the code will run the default section if the switch.

4)
The program call "./<programName>" is the first argument. If we do not shift argv before we begin looking for entries, this will be taken as the first key word.

5)
Added line to increment the entries pointer at end of each loop.

Part 2
Questions:

1.
The cd (or chdir) command changes the unique "Working Directory" parameter of the process that executes it. If implemented externally a new process would be spawned to run the cd command and the cd would in turn change the address of the process that called it(the new process)then exit, but would not change the directory of the parent process it was called by (because they are seperate processes). 

2.
The shell uses the chdir command to change the path given by the user into a specific working directory that can be set as the current processes working directory, then assigns this new PATH to the processes working directory.

3.
If we do not use the fork command no copy of the program executes and the program will end after executing the command. This is because execv() replaces the current process image with the one declared to be executed, so our shell will essentially be terminated. Hence why we need the fork() to create a copy that will not run the exec comand but rather comtinue after the command is executed.  

4.
The return value of fork is either -1, 0 or the pid of the successfully created child process that is a copy of the current process dowwn to the trace that will run in parallel with the parent. If fork returns a positive pid it implies the parent successfully created the child and hence the current process knows it is the parent and can execute accordingly. If fork() returns 0 it means that no copy was created from this process and no error was encountered hence the current process is the copy (child) and should thus execute the instruction input. 

5.
The working directory of our parent shell would never change. Only the newly created processes working directory will change and the process will exit. No matter how many times we run it cd  would not affect our current parent shell.

6.
We can run multiple versions. Their output is tracked by the pid and their counts remain relatively the same (each countdown happens independently but are all printed in the terminal.

7.
Yes we can run multiple instances of the shell (I tried 3) inside our shell. The shell most recently called will take the instructions and run them (But will not affect the parent shells it was called by.

8.
The count immediately stops and the shell exits in both cases. This is because termination of the parent process results in the termination of all its spawned processes.

9.
Yes a shell can kill itself. A shell within a shell can kill the parent, but this will result in the exit of the shell within the shell as well. However, the process will still be visible to the ps command so it may simply be pushed to the background

10.
when we exit the background process will continue running and we can see it with the ps command. This may be because no signal has been setup to the background process to terminate it once the parent process had been terminated.


Modifications:

1.
Added path variable that gets added to any command that does not begin with a '.' or a '/'

2.
added a command counter(command_count) that incremets when argc > 0. Also modified print statement to include command count.

3.
Created an array of strings history to hold previous commands. New commands are dynamically allocated space while command recalls with '!' point to address of previous command. Created function destroy() to free memory used by history. Currently static but can be made dynamic to hold a larger history.

4.
changed function

5.
Added block of code to differentiate sub from other commands executed.
Used getpid to change pid for each subshell.

6.
Added a level counter to track subshell level. Added definition MAX_SHELL_LEVEL to check if maximum subshell level was reached.
