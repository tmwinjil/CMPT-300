Review of C
-----------

SMP0 is a crash course in C.  These are some of the topics you will need
to keep in mind for all of the sample machine problems.

Common gotchas for new C programmers:
- C strings
- switch, case, break statements
- pointers
- pointers to pointers
- pointer arithmetic
- using argv and argc
- ?: syntax
- comma operator (only used occasionally, but can be useful)
- static, heap and stack variables
- C library functions for string handling

Pointers and dereferencing syntax (* &)

String handling and library I/O:
- strcmp, strcpy, strlen, strcat
- atoi, atol
- puts, fputs, printf, fprintf, fopen, fclose, scanf
- using man pages to determine which library must be included

Low-level system I/O:
- open, write, close

Concepts:
- declaration vs. definition of variables and functions
- scope of functions and variables
- how the linker glues separate compilation units together
- header files and preprocessor directives (#include, #ifdef)

Skills:
- using man pages to look up information, e.g., man strcmp
- understanding compiler and runtime messages
- using gdb to debug crashes (segfaults)
- using an editor to write code
- creating and modifying make files
- divide and conquer approaches to bugs and implementation problems

Defensive programming and debugging:
- using assert.h
- using write, fprintf(stderr, format, ...)

Man pages:
When you need specific information about some C function (e.g., return
values, argument types, multithreading safety properties), man pages may
provide the answer.  Run "man <function name>" from the shell to view
the appropriate man page.
